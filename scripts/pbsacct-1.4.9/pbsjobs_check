# Summarize accounting information in $PBS/server_priv/accounting files.

# Usage: cat <files> | pbsjobs [-S]
# where <files> are daily record files (such as 200812?? for one month's files).

# The format of Torque accounting records are defined on the page
# http://www.clusterresources.com/torquedocs21/9.1accounting.shtml
# For further details see src/include/acct.h:
#define PBS_ACCT_QUEUE  (int)'Q'        /* Job Queued record */
#define PBS_ACCT_RUN    (int)'S'        /* Job run (Started) */
#define PBS_ACCT_RERUN  (int)'R'        /* Job Rerun record */
#define PBS_ACCT_CHKPNT (int)'C'        /* Job Checkpointed and held */
#define PBS_ACCT_RESTRT (int)'T'        /* Job resTart (from chkpnt) record */
#define PBS_ACCT_END    (int)'E'        /* Job Ended/usage record */
#define PBS_ACCT_DEL    (int)'D'        /* Job Deleted by request */
#define PBS_ACCT_ABT    (int)'A'        /* Job Abort by server */

# The -S (for "Single") should be used if you use the MAUI scheduler's single
# job/task/user per node features NODEACCESSPOLICY=SINGLEUSER/SINGLEJOB/SINGLETASK
# (see http://www.clusterresources.com/products/maui/docs/5.3nodeaccess.shtml).
# Check your MAUI config by "showconfig | grep NODEACCESSPOLICY".
# In this case a job is charged for the use of ALL PROCESSORS of a node.
# Default: the actual number of processors used within each node.

# New in version 1.4.9: Job account_string (see http://www.clusterresources.com/torquedocs21/commands/qsub.shtml)
# If the user submits a job with the flag "-A <account_string>" (max 8 chars)
# then that string replaces the UNIX group name in the job accounting output.
# The user may run jobs under different accounts which get accounted for separately by pbsacct.
